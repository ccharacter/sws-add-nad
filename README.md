This plugin is designed for a situation where multiple copies of a site are in use.

It will automatically insert the following code at the bottom of the *content()* on the Home and About pages:

&lt;span style="opacity:0.02"&gt;SERVER_NAME_HERE&lt;/span&gt;

You can manually insert the same code anywhere you want using the shortcode, _sws_server_tag_.
